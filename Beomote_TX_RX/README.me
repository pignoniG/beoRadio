This folder includes a modified version of Beomote by christianlykke9 https://github.com/christianlykke9/Beomote
it is simplified as it doesn't attempt to decode the blink messages but it is also now able to receive full length Master Control Link messages (not only the short remote control messages) and it can be used used also to send messages.
